# nextjs-starter

A starter project for Next.js with lots of features

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Pages

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### API Routes

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Styles

All styles are available under `src/assets/*`. The styles auto-updates as you edit the file.

Styles targetting pages are available under `src/assets/pages/*`, and targetting components under `src/assets/components/*`. They both use [Component-level CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) support.
Component and pages styles can be imported at the Typescript/Javascript level.

To edit default values for site, you can edit `src/assets/theme/variables.scss`.

Default support for:

- Foundation 6 breakpoint mixins
- [Bulma CSS Classes](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/classes/)
- [Flexbox Grid CSS Classes](http://flexboxgrid.com/)
- [Fontawesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use)
